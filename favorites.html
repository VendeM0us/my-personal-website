            Don't let the character design fool you. This anime is very dark. But it's a masterpiece in any form.

            ReLIFE has a special place in my heart. This anime gave me a lot of lesson. The manga is one of the most beautiful stories I've read.

            One of the masterpieces I want to rewatch again once I got comfortable at Japanese. I felt like I lose a lot of language play when I watched this. Very funny and cool anime nonetheless.

            When it comes to the most hilarious anime. No one can top this in my ranking. Watching this makes me dream of a college life I'm pretty sure I won't get.

            This anime is a hidden gem. It's one of the most unique slice of life I've ever seen. Everything about it is wonderful, I just can't put it into words how wonderful this anime is.
