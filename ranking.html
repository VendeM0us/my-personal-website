        <h2>Web Geek</h2>
        <p>
          I love visiting various websites. There's not a single day where I don't browse the internet. Internet has been part of my daily
           routine already. Here are some of the websites I frequently love visiting and using.

            <h3>Discord</h3>
            <img src="./images/discord.jpeg" alt="discord"><br>

            <p>One thing I like about Discord is you can find a circle to your fitting. I always join Discord groups
              about Japanese learning and software engineering. Through Discord, I feel not isolated as I find people with same hobbies as mine while
              being able to maintain my anonymity.

            <h3>Youtube</h3>
            <img src="./images/youtube.jpg" alt="youtube"><br>

            <p>
              I browse Youtube every day. Everytime I want to feel entertained, I always open Youtube. Youtube is also great for learning stuff. But it can
              sometimes kill productivity as browsing Youtube videos is pretty addictive.

            <h3>Google</h3>
            <img src="./images/google.jpg" alt="google"><br>

            <p>
              Google is my best friend whenever I feel stuck at a coding question. It's my best friend whenever I'm in pinch mode. I mean, who doesn't love google?
              It's the programmer's best friend after all.

            <p>
              My number 1 website when learning web development. I love open app academy. Their lessons are very dense and I learn I lot. I can't express how much I love this website.
               Web development has been more achievable thanks for discovering this.

            <h3>Facebook</h3>

            <p>
              I really don't like using Facebook and I try to stay away with it as much as possible. However, Facebook Messenger is really
              important for me as it is my only means of communication to people that I know. I use messenger pretty much everyday.
