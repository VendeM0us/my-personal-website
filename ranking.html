        <p>
          I love visiting various websites. There's not a single day where I don't browse the internet. Internet has been part of my daily
           routine already. Here are some of the websites I frequently love visiting and using.

                <p>One thing I like about Discord is you can find a circle to your fitting. I always join Discord groups
                  about Japanese learning and software engineering. Through Discord, I feel not isolated as I find people with same hobbies as mine while
                  being able to maintain my anonymity.

                  I browse Youtube every day. Everytime I want to feel entertained, I always open Youtube. Youtube is also great for learning stuff. But it can
                  sometimes kill productivity as browsing Youtube videos is pretty addictive.

                  Google is my best friend whenever I feel stuck at a coding question. It's my best friend whenever I'm in pinch mode. I mean, who doesn't love google?
                  It's the programmer's best friend after all.

                  I really don't like using Facebook and I try to stay away with it as much as possible. However, Facebook Messenger is really
                  important for me as it is my only means of communication to people that I know. I use messenger pretty much everyday.
