          <h2>About Me:</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Mayolito C. Waje. I am 20 years old as of the moment I am writing this website. I am a college student currently taking computer science.
            I used to be an accounting student but later I found my passion in software engineering so I switched my major which I didn't regret at all. I am still at my freshman
            but I am going to do my best to be at par with my competitors in the software engineering field.

          <h2>Enjoyer of Japanese Culture</h2>
          <p>Aside from coding, I love learning Japanese language. I am determined to reach fluency in Japanese and hope that one day I might be able to visit the country (or live there :D).
            I love reading visual novels, manga, and light novels in Japanese. I watch anime sometimes too, though not that frequent.

          <h2>A Passionate Man</h2>
          <p>Whenever I desire something, I give all my best to achieve it. Though I still didn't reached mastery to any of the things I am currently learning and striving for, I hope one day it will bring
             success. I always tell to myself to never give up cause every experience is valuable in my self improvement even though I failed to reach a certain road.
